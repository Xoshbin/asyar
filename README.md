# Asyar

**An open-source alternative to Raycast.**

Asyar is a fast, extensible command launcher built with modern web technologies. It allows you to quickly search for applications, run commands, access clipboard history, and much more through a growing ecosystem of extensions.

Built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/), [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

**⚠️ Disclaimer: Not Production Ready ⚠️**

**Asyar is currently under active development and is NOT considered stable or production-ready.** The codebase is evolving, and you may encounter bugs or breaking changes. The code is also in need of significant refactoring. Use at your own risk!

---

## Current Status & Contributing

The `main` branch represents the current development state. However, the `store` branch is significantly ahead, focusing on implementing an extension store and pushing towards a more stable, production-ready state.

**Contributions are highly welcome!** We especially need help on the `store` branch to improve stability, refactor the codebase, and get Asyar ready for wider use. If you're interested in contributing, please check out the `store` branch.

## Features

- **Application Launcher:** Quickly find and launch installed applications.
- **Command Execution:** Run custom commands defined by extensions.
- **Extensible:** Add new functionality through a simple extension API. See the [Extension Development Guide](docs/extension-development.md) for details on creating your own extensions.
- **Clipboard History:** (Via built-in extension) Access and search your clipboard history.
- **Modern Tech Stack:** Leverages the speed and safety of Rust (Tauri backend) and the efficiency of SvelteKit (frontend).
